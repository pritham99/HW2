# HW2
Clone the repository. Navigate to the hw2 directory. Execute the hw2_seq2seq.sh script, which requires two parameters:
1.Data Directory
2.The directory to save the output captions.
Note: Since the model is too big to upload in the GitHub, I have uploaded the model to the Google drive. Here is the link to access:
